A python project I made at university, for a module called Computational Creativity back in April 2022. 

This uses Sentiment Analysis to read an inputted text and generate an image of a planet from the emotions described by the user. 

The idea was that is a user typed in a sadder, more gloomy text then the horizon and sky would be darker colours, and if the user typed happy text it would display more bright colours.
